- [ ] I ran `make setup && make` to update the generated code after editing a `.atd` file (TODO: have a CI check)
- [ ] I made sure we're still backward compatible with old versions of the CLI.
      For example, the Semgrep backend need to still be able to *consume* data
	  generated by Semgrep 1.50.0.
      See https://atd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/atdgen-tutorial.html#smooth-protocol-upgrades
	  Note that the types related to the semgrep-core JSON output or the
	  semgrep-core RPC do not need to be backward compatible!
- [ ] Any accompanying changes in `semgrep-proprietary` are approved and ready to merge once this PR is merged
