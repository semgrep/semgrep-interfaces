# This script is used in CI to ensure that we don't introduce breaking changes to the semgrep_output_v1.atd file.
# We need this since the backend uses the latest ATD's to validate/parse JSON from all supported client versions.
# Adding fields as required breaks the backend when an older client doesn't send this field.
#
# The rough idea here is:
#  - Fetch the minimum supported version from the semgrep.dev API
#  - Enumerate all tags since the minimum version
#  - For each tag we need to support:
#    - Diff against origin/main to establish a baseline
#    - Diff against HEAD
#    - Diff the two diffs to see if new issues were introduced
