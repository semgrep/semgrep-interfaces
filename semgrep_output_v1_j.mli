(**
  Specification of the Semgrep CLI JSON output formats using ATD (see
  https://atd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for information on ATD).
  
  This file specifies mainly the JSON formats of:
  
  - the output of the [semgrep scan --json] command
  
  - the output of the [semgrep test --json] command
  
  - the messages exchanged with the Semgrep backend by the [semgrep ci]
  command
  
  It's also (ab)used to specify the JSON input and output of semgrep-core,
  some RPC between pysemgrep and semgrep-core, and a few more internal
  things. We should use separate .atd for those different purposes but ATD
  does not have a proper module system yet and many types are shared so it is
  simpler for now to have everything in one file.
  
  There are other important form of outputs which are not specified here:
  
  - The semgrep metrics sent to https://metrics.semgrep.dev in
  semgrep_metrics.atd
  
  - The parsing stats of semgrep-core -parsing_stats -json have its own
  Parsing_stats.atd
  
  For the definition of the Semgrep input (the rules), see rule_schema_v2.atd
  
  This file has the _v1 suffix to explicitely represent the version of this
  JSON format. If you need to extend this file, please be careful because you
  may break consumers of this format (e.g., the Semgrep playground or Semgrep
  backend or external users of this JSON). See
  https://atd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/atdgen-tutorial.html#smooth-protocol-upgrades
  for more information on how to smoothly extend the types in this file.
  
  Any backward incompatible changes should require to upgrade the major
  version of Semgrep as this JSON output is part of the "API" of Semgrep (any
  incompatible changes to the rule format should also require a major version
  upgrade). Hopefully, we will always be backward compatible. However, a few
  fields are tagged with \[EXPERIMENTAL\] meaning external users should not
  rely on them as those fields may be changed or removed. They are not part
  of the "API" of Semgrep.
  
  Again, keep in mind that this file is used both by the CLI to *produce* a
  JSON output, and by our backends to *consume* the JSON, including to
  consume the JSON produced by old versions of the CLI. As of Nov 2024, our
  backend is still supporting as far as Semgrep 1.50.0 released Nov 2023.
  (see server/semgrep_app/util/cli_version_support.py in the semgrep-app
  repo)
  
  This file is translated in OCaml modules by atdgen. Look for the
  corresponding Semgrep_output_v1_\[tj\].ml\[i\] generated files under dune's
  _build/ folder. A few types below have the 'deriving show' decorator
  because those types are reused in semgrep core data structures and we make
  heavy use of 'deriving show' in OCaml to help debug things.
  
  This file is also translated in Python modules by atdpy. For Python, a few
  types have the 'dataclass(frozen=True)' decorator so that the class can be
  hashed and put in set. Indeed, with 'Frozen=True' the class is immutable
  and dataclass can autogenerate a hash function for it.
  
  Finally this file is translated in jsonschema/openapi spec by atdcat, and
  in Typescript modules by atdts.
  
  History:
  
  - the types in this file were originally inferred from JSON_report.ml for
  use by spacegrep when it was separate from semgrep-core. It's now also
  useds in JSON_report.ml (now called Core_json_output.ml)
  
  - it was extended to not only support semgrep-core JSON output but also
  (py)semgrep CLI output!
  
  - it was then simplified with the osemgrep migration effort by removing
  gradually the semgrep-core JSON output.
  
  - it was extended to support 'semgrep ci' output to type most messages sent
  between the Semgrep CLI and the Semgrep backend
  
  - we use this file to specify RPCs between pysemgrep and semgrep-core for
  the gradual migration effort of osemgrep
  
  - merged what was in Input_to_core.atd here

  EXPERIMENTAL
  
  A "matching diagnosis" is a postprocessed interpretation of matching
  explanations, specific to a particular test-annotated target file.
  
  For instance, suppose we have the rule:
  
{v
    1 | all:
    2 | - pattern: foo(...)
    3 | - not: foo(goood)
v}
  
  and the following Python annotated target:
  
{v
    1 | # ruleid: my_rule
    2 | foo()
    3 | # ok: my_rule
    4 | foo(good)
v}
  
  We would get an unexpected match on line 4, which would fail the test
  assertion.
  
  By looking at the matching explanation, we can deduce that the match on
  line 4 must clearly have been introduced by the positive [foo(..)] pattern.
  The rule-writer probably meant to kill [foo(good)] with the negative
  [foo(goood)] pattern.
  
  This is essentially what matching diagnoses are -- using matching
  explanations to point out where the erroneous parts of the rule _may_ be.
  
  Note that this is a _may_, because an unexpected match could have been
  killed by the [foo(bad)], but if there were more negative patterns, it
  could have been killed elsewhere too. All we can do is point out places
  where the rule-writer _may_ have messed up.
  
  So in this case, we would expect an [unexpected_match_diagnosis] with the
  form:
  
{v
    \{ matched_text = \{ line = 4; text = "foo(bad)" \};
      originating_kind = Xpattern;
      originating_text = \{ line = 2; text = "- pattern: foo(...)" \};
      killing_parents = [
        \{ killing_parent_kind = Negation;
          snippet = \{ line = 3; text = "- not: foo(good)" \} \}
      ]

v}
